A Docker image is a lightweight, standalone package that includes all the necessary binaries, libraries, and dependencies required to run a software application. 
It as a blueprint or template that defines everything the application needs to function.

When starting out with Docker, most software components are distributed in the form of Docker images. These images serve as the foundation for creating containers,
allowing consistent and portable application deployment across various environments.
