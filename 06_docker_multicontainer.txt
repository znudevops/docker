Approaches to Multi-Container Architecture in Docker

There are three main ways to set up a multi-container architecture using Docker:

1. `--link` (Deprecated)
   - This was an early method for connecting containers and enabling communication between them.  
   - Itâ€™s now considered outdated and has been largely replaced by Docker networks.

2. Docker Compose  
   - A powerful tool that lets you define and manage multi-container applications using a `docker-compose.yml` file.  
   - You can configure services, networks, volumes, and dependencies all in one place.

3. Docker Networks
   - This is the modern and flexible way to connect multiple containers.  
   - Containers on the same custom network can easily discover and communicate with each other using service names.
