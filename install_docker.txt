To install Docker on Amazon Linux 2 or Amazon Linux 2023
Update the installed packages and package cache on your instance.
$ sudo yum update -y

Install the most recent Docker Community Edition package.

For Amazon Linux 2, run the following:
$ sudo amazon-linux-extras install docker

For Amazon Linux 2023, run the following:
$ sudo yum install -y docker

Start the Docker service.
$ sudo service docker start

Add the ec2-user to the docker group so that you can run Docker commands without using sudo.
$ sudo usermod -a -G docker ec2-user

Pick up the new docker group permissions by logging out and logging back in again. To do this, close your current SSH terminal window and reconnect to your instance in a new one. Your new SSH session should have the appropriate docker group permissions.

Verify that the ec2-user can run Docker commands without using sudo.
$ docker ps
