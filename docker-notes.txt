Virtualization
===================
This is the process of running multiple OS's parallelly on a single peace of h/w.
Here we have h/w(bare metal) on top of which we have host OS
and on the host OS we install an application called as hypervisor
On the hypervisor we can run any no of OS's as guest OS

The disadvantage of this approach is these application running on the
guest OS have to pass through n number of lavers to access the H/W
resources.

Containarization
======================
Here we have bare metal on top of which we install the host OS
and on the host OS we install an application called as Docker Engine
On the docker engine we can run any application in the form of containers
Docker is a technology for creating these containers

Docker achieve what is commonly called as "process isolation"
i.e. all the applications(processes) have some dependency on a specific
OS. This dependency is removed by docker and we can run them on any
OS as containers if we have Docker engine installed

These containers pass through less no of layers to access the h/w resources
also organizations need not spend money on purchasing licenses of different
OS's to maintain various applications

Docker can be used at the stages of S/W development life cycle
Build---->Ship--->Run


What is docker?
  Docker is an opensource containerizing technology. It allows build, package and run the apllication in containers.
  It provides the process isolation, whcih is not depends on the os.

Docker is an open-source containerization technology that enables you to build, package, and run applications as lightweight containers. These containers encapsulate the application along with its dependencies, allowing it to run consistently across different environments.
Docker provides process isolation, meaning each application runs independently in its own container. This isolation does not rely on the host operating system, making the containers portable and OS-agnosticâ€”as long as Docker is installed.

Install docker on Linux
==============================
1 Create an Ubuntu instance on AWS
2 Connect to it using git bash
3 Execute the below 2 commands
  curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
  sh get-docker.sh

Images and Containers
===========================
A Docker image is a combination of bin/libs that are necessary
for a s/w application to work. Initially all the s/w's of docker 
are available in the form of docker images

A running instance of an image is called as a container

Docker Host: The server where docker is installed is called docker host

Docker Client: This is the CLI of docker where the user can execute the docker commands, The docker client accepts these commands and passes them
to a background process called "docker daemon"

Docker daemon: This process accepts the commands coming from the docker client and routes them to work on docker images or containers or the docker registry

Docker registry: This is the cloud site of docker where docker images are
stored. This is of two types
1 Public Registry( hub.docker.com)
2 Private Registry(Setup on one of our local servers)
