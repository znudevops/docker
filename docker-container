A running instance of an image is known as container.

Working on docker containers
==================================
To create a container from image:
docker run image_name/image_id
  
13 To see the list of running containers
   docker container ls

14 To see the list of all containers (running and stopped)
   docker ps -a

15 To start a container
   docker start container_id/container_name

16 To stop a container
   docker stop container_id/container_name

17 To restart a container
   docker restart container_id/container_name
   To restart after 10 seconds
   docker restart -t 10 container_id/container_name

18 To delete a stopped container
   docker rm container_id/container_name

19 To delete a running container
   docker rm -f container_id/container_name

20 To stop all running container
   docker stop $(docker ps -aq)

21 To delete all stopped containers
   docker rm $(docker ps -aq)

22 To delete all running and stopped containers
   docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq)

23 To get detailed info about a container
   docker inspect container_id/container_name

24 To see the logs genearated by a container
   docker logs container_id/container_name

25 To create a docker container
   docker run image_name/image_id
   run command options
   ---------------------
   --name:  USed to give a name to the container
   --restart: Used to keep the container in running condition
   -d: Used to run the container in detached mode in background
   -it: Used to open interactive terminal in the container
   -e: Used to pass environment variables to the container
   -v : Used to attach an external device or folder as a volume
   --volumes-from: Used to share volume between multiple containers
   -p : Used for port mapping.It will link the container port with
        host port. Eg: -p 8080:80 Here 8080 is host port(external port)
        and 80 is container port(internal port)
   -P: Used for automatic port mapping where the container port is
       mapped with some host port that is greater than 30000
   --link : Used to create a link between multiple containers to create a
            microservices architecture.
   --network: Used to start a container on a specific network
   -rm : Used to delete a container on exit
   -m: Used to specify the upper limit on the amount of memory that 
       a container can use
   -c: Used to specify the upper limit on the amount of cpu a container can use
   -ip: Used to assign
 an ip to the container

26 To see the ports used by a container
   docker port container_id/container_name

27 To run any process in a container from outside the container
   docker exec -it container_id/container_name process_name
   Eg: To run the bash process in a container
   docker exec -it container_id/container_name bash

28 To come out of a container without exit
   ctrl+p,ctrl+q

29  To go back into a container from where the interactive terminal is running
    docker attach container_id/container_name

30  To see the processes runnign in a container
    docker container container_id/container_name top
